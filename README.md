# Portfolio
Hello! I can't show you everything I've built at professionally, but I can show a few snippets of code I've written, as well as, some independent projects.

## Data Analysis Notebooks

### [E Commerce Data Analysis](NoteBooks/Google_Merch_Analysis.ipynb)

### [Vaccination Public Opinion Analysis](NoteBooks/Twitter_Analysis.ipynb)

### [Using Gradient Boosting to Augment Polling Results](NoteBooks/Gradient_Boosting_With_Polling_Results.ipynb)
I use a script similar to this one to make creat demographic models based on survey results. Gradient Boosting allows me to aggregate weak predictors like individual polls and preform a more accurate classification.

### [Cleaning and Wrangling Messy Data](NoteBooks/LAPD_911_Data_Wrangling.ipynb)

### [Time Series Vizualization](NoteBooks/Sample_Time_Series.ipynb)

### Zoom Export and Analysis
- [Survey Vizualization](NoteBooks/Zoom_Poll_ChartMaker.ipynb) 
I use this script to create vizualizations from the raw output of zoom polling data. It enables a user to load data as a csv and a export bar charts for ready for distribution.    

- [Text Analysis](NoteBooks/Zoom_Transcript_Text_Mining.ipynb)
I use this script to preform basic text mining from raw transcript files exported from a zoom meeting. This script is focused on very basic data cleaning and formatting with some aggregated metrics. It exports the data into a structure that makes it accesiable for more complex NLP like GPT-2

## Dashboard Applications

### [Display Changing Enviromental Metrics with Shiny](Shiny Apps/ShinyDashBoard/App.R)

### [Measuring Classification Results with Streamlit](Streamlit Apps/ML_APP/streamlit-ml/app.py)
